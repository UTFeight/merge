# Merge Macro Parser

Macro Parser for Merge Programming Language.

## Usage

Merge Macros are inspired from Rust Macros. They are used to generate code at compile time.

### Syntax

```rs
![my_macro]
```

You cannot write a macro in Merge but you can use it. All Merge macros are written in Rust (in the language wrapper) and can be added using Merge's module system (Just a thought for the future nothing more)
